Package: tidextractr
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Title: Extraction of Tidal Values in R
Description: This package provides a basic interface with the XTide library
  for estimation of tidal covariates. The package was developed to support analysis
  of harbor seal aerial survey and haul-out behavior in Alaska. However, use is
  not limited to this situation. The package does not include the XTide library and,
  thus, the library and command line tool must be installed. A vignette will provide
  some guidance for installation. Users may wish to investigate the rtide package
  as an alternative that includes native support for some of the station locations.
  Special thanks and attribution to David Flater for development and support of
  the XTide library (http://www.flaterco.com/xtide/xtide.html).
